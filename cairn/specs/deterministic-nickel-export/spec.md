# Deterministic Nickel Export Specification

## Purpose

Provide evaluator-neutral, exact-byte Nickel export identities, receipts, compatibility projections, and freshness checks without taking evaluator, filesystem, consumer-policy, or release authority.

## Requirements

### Requirement: The shared core is evaluator-neutral

r[nickel_export.core.evaluator_neutral] `nickel-export-core` MUST compile with `#![no_std]` plus `alloc` and MUST NOT read files, inspect environment state, spawn processes, print, consult clocks, perform network I/O, or evaluate Nickel.

#### Scenario: Core is built for Wasm
- GIVEN default and serialization features are disabled
- WHEN the core is checked for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- THEN it MUST compile without std or evaluator dependencies.

### Requirement: Exact identities bind complete declared material

r[nickel_export.core.identity] The core MUST bind exact source, complete declared dependency, selector, contract, evaluator descriptor, output format, destination, and output bytes into versioned receipts using BLAKE3 for project-owned identities.

#### Scenario: Any exact artifact changes
- GIVEN an admitted receipt input
- WHEN one source, dependency, or output byte changes
- THEN the corresponding identity and canonical receipt MUST change.

#### Scenario: Dependency material is incomplete
- GIVEN a request names a dependency with no matching exact material
- WHEN receipt admission runs
- THEN admission MUST fail closed.

### Requirement: Evaluation and contract failures produce no receipt

r[nickel_export.core.fail_closed] The core MUST reject evaluator or contract error diagnostics, undeclared observed dependencies, incomplete evaluator-observed closures, unsafe paths, mixed evaluator manifests, duplicate destinations, and conservative secret-like material without explicit opt-in.

#### Scenario: Contract returns an error diagnostic
- GIVEN exact output bytes and a contract error
- WHEN receipt admission runs
- THEN no successful receipt MUST be produced.

#### Scenario: Manifest mixes evaluator cohorts
- GIVEN individually valid receipts from different evaluator descriptors
- WHEN manifest construction runs
- THEN manifest construction MUST fail.

### Requirement: Filesystem and evaluator authority stay in a thin shell

r[nickel_export.shell.authority] The std CLI MUST keep file reads, explicit external Nickel execution, output writes, process diagnostics, and check-mode orchestration outside the pure core.

#### Scenario: Check mode sees tampered output
- GIVEN a valid checked-in output and manifest
- WHEN output bytes are changed
- THEN `nickel-export ... --check` MUST fail without rewriting either artifact.

#### Scenario: Request path escapes the root
- GIVEN an absolute or parent-traversing request path
- WHEN the CLI validates the request
- THEN evaluation and output writes MUST NOT occur.

### Requirement: Compatibility does not create competing semantic owners

r[nickel_export.compat.projections] The core MUST provide versioned one-way Octet and Mantle compatibility projections while consumer evaluator semantics, destination authority, policy, lifecycle gates, and release authority remain consumer-owned.

#### Scenario: Legacy projection is requested
- GIVEN a canonical admitted receipt or manifest
- WHEN an Octet or Mantle projection is derived
- THEN exact identities and non-claims MUST be preserved without re-evaluating Nickel.

### Requirement: Consumer cutover is pinned and reversible

r[nickel_export.migration.dual_run] Consumers MUST pin an immutable standalone revision, dual-run legacy and canonical paths over identical material, classify all differences, retain rollback, and prohibit workspace-relative release dependencies.

#### Scenario: Dual-run results diverge
- GIVEN legacy and canonical output or identity evidence differs
- WHEN migration validation runs
- THEN the legacy path MUST remain authoritative until an owning regression fixture explains the difference.

### Requirement: Release evidence is reproducible and bounded

r[nickel_export.release.profile] The repository MUST publish typed configuration, checked exports, pinned Nix and Rust inputs, exact evaluator cohort, positive and negative fixtures, host and Wasm core checks, CLI tamper tests, license metadata, and explicit non-claims.

#### Scenario: Typed export is stale
- GIVEN repository or release Nickel source differs from its checked JSON export
- WHEN Nix release validation runs
- THEN validation MUST fail closed.
